1. API1 had multiple syntax errors and is now fixed.
2. API2 successfully ran after changing sender ID value and adding necessary headers as in API1.
3. Templates have been simply combined with no additional features. Single envelope has been sent successfully.

I was able to confirm that all three requests were successfull as I can view them in the outbox in my personal Developer Environment. I'm looking forward to our discussion.

NOTE: Authorization and Accept headers in Postman are required for successful execution.
