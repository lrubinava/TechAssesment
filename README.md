1. API1 had multiple syntax errors and is now fixed. Note: actual Personal ID and access token aren't dispalyed here.
2. API2 successfully ran after changing Personal ID value and adding necessary headers as in API1.
3. Templates have been simply combined using *compositeTemplates* property with no additional features. Single envelope has been sent successfully.

I was able to confirm that all three requests were successfull as I can view them in the outbox in my personal Developer Environment. I'm looking forward to our discussion.
